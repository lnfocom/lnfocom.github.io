## Origins Of Zork
[Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork) is one of the earliest interactive fiction computer games. Originally written around 1977 it used the MDL Programming Language on a PDP-10 Computer. Since then programming has come a long way.

### This Project
This project is primarily aimed at practicing the use of objects and consolidating the large scaling dictionaries of commands. The plan is to expand this game as far as possible. Adding rooms, enemies and a possible connection to **Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz**.
